@code{(require 'color-database)}
@ftindex color-database


@defun file->color-dictionary file table-name rdb base-table-type


@defunx file->color-dictionary file table-name rdb

@var{rdb} must be an open relational database or a string naming a relational
database file, @var{table-name} a symbol, and the string @var{file} must name an existing
file with colornames and their corresponding xRGB (6-digit hex)
values.  @code{file->color-dictionary} creates a table @var{table-name} in @var{rdb} and enters the associations found
in @var{file} into it.
@end defun


@defun url->color-dictionary url table-name rdb base-table-type


@defunx url->color-dictionary url table-name rdb

@var{rdb} must be an open relational database or a string naming a relational
database file and @var{table-name} a symbol.  @code{url->color-dictionary} retrieves the resource named by the
string @var{url} using the @dfn{wget} program; then calls
@cindex wget
@code{file->color-dictionary} to enter its associations in @var{table-name} in @var{url}.

@noindent
This section has detailed the procedures for creating and loading
color dictionaries.  So where are the dictionaries to load?

@uref{http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/Dictionaries.html}

@noindent
Describes and evaluates several color-name dictionaries on the web.
The following procedure creates a database containing two of these
dictionaries.


@defun make-slib-color-name-db

Creates an @r{alist-table} relational database in @r{library-vicinity}
containing the @dfn{Resene} and @dfn{saturate} color-name
@cindex Resene
@cindex saturate
dictionaries.

If the files @file{resenecolours.txt}, @file{nbs-iscc.txt}, and
@file{saturate.txt} exist in the @r{library-vicinity}, then they
used as the source of color-name data.  Otherwise, @code{make-slib-color-name-db} calls
url->color-dictionary with the URLs of appropriate source files.
